[[!meta title="Recycling Used Toner"]]

OCF goes through toners quite fast, due to the heavy volume of printing from our users. In the past, we've let it accumulate inside the storage room which resulted in accidental toner spillage. The following document contains how to recycle the toners and hope to encourage rapid removal of the toners from OCF space.

## Options to dispose the toners

* We can dispose the toners by returning them to Staples down at the Shattuck Ave. They give us $2 Staples rewards per toner, and there is maximum limit of 10 toners per month. [Link](http://rewards.staples.com/SRC/faqs.do)

* Copy Center at Moffitt Library would accept our toners that are individually sealed in a garbage bag.

* Xerox Recycles HP toners. One can [order](https://www.xerox.com/perl-bin/product.pl?mode=recycling&XOGlang=en_US&referer=xrx) toner return box kit with a free return label. Once the kit arrives, put the used toners in the box and schedule a UPS pick up.
