[[!meta title="Recycling Used Toner"]]

OCF goes through toners quite fast, due to the heavy volume of printing from our
 users. In the past, we've let it accumulate inside the storage room which 
resulted in accidental toner spillage. The following document contains how 
to recycle the toners and hope to encourage rapid removal of the toners from OCF space.

OCF staffer should keep an eye out for the accumulation of the toners, and proactively
recycle the used toners as soon as possible.

## Options to dispose the toners

* We can dispose the toners by returning them to 
[Staples](https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/sustainability-center/recycling-
services/) down at the Shattuck Ave. They give us $2 Staples rewards per toner, and 
there is maximum limit of 10 toners per month. With the rewards, we can purchase 
snacks and etc from Staples.  
The rewards account information can be found in the passwd file.

* Copy Center at 3rd floor of Moffitt Library - to the right of FSM cafe when you enter the 
building - would accept our toners that are individually sealed in a garbage bag.

* Xerox Recycles HP toners. One can [order](https://www.xerox.com/perl-bin/product.p
l?mode=recycling&XOGlang=en_US&referer=xrx) toner return box kit with a free return 
label. Once the kit arrives, put the used toners in the box and schedule a UPS pick up.
