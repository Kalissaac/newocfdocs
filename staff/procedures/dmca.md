DMCA safe harbor provisions help "Online Service Providers" such as us
avoid liability from copyright infringement by our users.

As specified in our [[contact|doc contact]] page:

 * We are required to act upon a valid DMCA takedown notice sent to
   our DMCA designated agent (in the University). If we receive notices
   directly from outside the University, ask the complaining party
   to send a valid DMCA takedown notice to the designated agent.
   Please keep the University involved.
 * We also like to forward any takedown or cease and desist notices to
   the [Lumen database](https://lumendatabase.org/). Please ask for
   a copy of the original notice from the University if not provided.

An example of instructions for a DMCA takedown notice is the
[GitHub DMCA Takedown article](https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown).

If a DMCA takedown notice is received, refer to
[Guidelines for Compliance with the Online Service Provider Provisions
of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000472/DMCA), a 6-page document by the
University, which describes the procedure that we should follow:

 > 1. "Notice" is sent to the service provider by the complaining party.
 > 2. The service provider notifies the subscriber and removes or
 >    disables the allegedly infringing material.
 > 3. The service provider provides a copy to the complaining party of
 >    a timely counter-notice from the subscriber and notifies it that
 >    the removed or disabled material will be restored in no less
 >    than 10 business days and no more than 14 business days unless
 >    the entity notifies the provider that it has sought a court
 >    order for injunctive relief.
 > 4. The service provider restores the allegedly infringing material
 >    (to avoid liability to the subscriber) if it has not received a
 >    timely notice from the complaining party that injunctive relief
 >    has been sought.

(More details on each step are in the document.)

You can adapt the DMCA takedown procedure to other takedown or cease
and desist notices like trademark claims. Be sure to always provide
adequate notice to our users.
