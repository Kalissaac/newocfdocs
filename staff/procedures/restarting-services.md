## Taking production services offline

Staffers who wish to take any production service offline for longer than the
length of a reboot, or who wish to reboot a hypervisor hosting production
services must gain permission from the Site Managers or Deputy Site Managers
whenever possible.

Whenever a staffer restarts a production service, whether permission is
required or not, or restarts a machine that other users have running processes
on, they must give notice to other staffers of their actions as soon as
possible and ideally receive acknowledgement. The staffer should preferably do
this on IRC/Slack.

Staffers scheduling downtime for public-facing services should make a blog post
at [status.ocf.berkeley.edu][status] to give users sufficient advance notice.
Planned restarts of hypervisors should also be announced on this blog, since
restarting hypervisors can often take several minutes or more.
