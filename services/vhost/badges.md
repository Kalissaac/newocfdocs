These logos are for organizations that have requested virtual hosting with the
OCF, or for anyone else that wants to use them. You can either use the images
hosted on our site, or you can download them and place them under your own.
You're welcome to design your own too, but please contact the Site Manager
&lt;<sm@ocf.berkeley.edu>&gt; if you do so.

gordeon in 2007.

The "blue" logo is based off the "silver" logo and was contributed by the student
group Ensorcelled in 2008.
