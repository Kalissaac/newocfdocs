[[!meta title="Content Removal Policy"]]


## Introduction

The OCF maintains a strict policy of not removing or modifying content
hosted by user accounts unless legally compelled to do so, or if such
content is in violation of existing OCF account policies.

This means the OCF cannot, and will not, change or remove any text,
pictures, information, or other content hosted by an OCF user. Only the
user who owns the relevant OCF account can modify the data we host on
their behalf. We do however reserve the right to deactivate inactive
accounts at our discretion.

### Options for removing content

If you would like a document hosted by the OCF to be modified or removed,
you have a few options.

1. If the content falls under copyright protection, you may send a DMCA
takedown notice to the University, which will forward the request to us.
Do not send any notices to the OCF directly; we can only act on them if
they are sent to our designated agent.

2. You may try to contact the owner of the account in question and ask them
to make the relevant modifications. If contact information is not available
on the site itself, one can send an email to <username>@ocf.berkeley.edu,
where <username> is the username of the OCF account hosting the content.

3. If repeated attempts to contact the owner of the account fail, you may
request further contact information for the account from the OCF by
contacting us at [help@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:help@ocf.berkeley.edu).
We may provide further contact information, if we have any, at our
discretion.

4. If repeated attempts to contact the owner after step 3 fail, and we
determine that the account in question is inactive, we may, at our
discretion, choose to disable the account. However, if the account is
not inactive and the owner refuses to make the changes, the OCF will not
make any changes to user data without explicit consent from the account
owner.

Please note that emailing us asking to have content changed or removed
will not result in that outcome, even if you have exhausted all other
avenues. As stated before, we do not modify user data.
