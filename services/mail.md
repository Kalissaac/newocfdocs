## Student groups

We provide email hosting for student groups who have a
[[virtual host|doc services/vhost]] (e.g. mygroup.berkeley.edu).

We're working on improving our mail offering for student groups to support
additional features; in the mean-time, only mail forwarding is supported. See
[[here|doc services/vhost#email]] for instructions on configuring a forwarding
address.

## Individual accounts

Mail service for individual accounts was discontinued over summer 2014. We are
offering mail forwarding for a limited time, but this will cease to work in the
future (date TBD).

To configure a forwarding address, log in via [[SSH|doc services/shell]] and enter the
`update-email` command to view or update your register email address.

Note that sending mail from your individual OCF account is no longer possible.
