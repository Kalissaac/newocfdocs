[[!meta title="Printing"]]

The OCF offers a certain amount of printing to individual members. You don't
have to request a new account each semester - the quota is refreshed at the
start of each semester.

Printing is currently limited to:

 * 100 pages per semester
 * 10 pages per day on weekdays
 * 20 pages per day on weekends

Please note:

 * Each **printed side** of a sheet counts as a page.
 * Jobs take time to process proportional to the job size.  If you submit a
   large job, please be patient while the print server processes it.


## Remaining quota

To see how many pages you have left for the day and semester, run the `paper`
command [[over the web|commands]] or [[in the shell|doc services/shell]]. Print
quota is also displayed at the top of the screen when using a lab computer.
Check your print balance regularly!

## Printing refunds

Pages are **not** normally refunded, except in cases of technical issues. In
this case, you should talk with the OCF Operations Staff at the front desk
for a refund.

## Technical details

See [[staff documentation|doc staff/procedures/printing]].

## Amendment of printing quota
<!-- RT#6159 -->
The Board of Directors holds the authority to make changes to the printing
quota. When the OCF is not formally in session (i.e. during breaks), the
Cabinet can make provisional changes to the printing quota. If the changes are
ratified at the first Board meeting of the next formal session, they will
become permanent; otherwise they will expire.
