## The mission

The OCF is an all-volunteer, student-run, student-initiated service group
dedicated to free computing for all [University of California at
Berkeley][berkeley] students, faculty, and staff.  The mission of the OCF is to
provide an environment where no member of Berkeley's campus community is denied
the computer resources he or she seeks, and to appeal to all members of the
Berkeley campus community with unsatisfied computing needs and to provide a
place for those interested in computing to fully explore that interest.

## What do we do?

The Open Computing Facility provides free computing services to student,
faculty, and staff, ranging from free printing to expiration-free web
space to Unix shell accounts to email. Furthermore, the OCF operates a
highly frequented long-hours computing lab with a generally high
volunteer-staff-to-user ratio for accessible in-person support, as well
as online support. In addition to these user services, the group also
hosts numerous student group websites, and provides support to these and
other organizations on campus.

To be able to do this, we are always aiming to secure more resources to
fully meet the needs of everyone in the campus community.  Our primary
resources are our GNU/Linux workstations and servers, entirely
administered by [[student volunteers|doc staff]].
These resources are located within our computing lab on the ground floor of MLK
Student Union.

To help people explore the field of computing and educate them about the
resources available, the OCF also provides a variety of educational services.
We used to co-sponsor a series of Help Sessions, short classes taught
throughout the semester on a wide range of computing topics, from beginner to
advanced levels, and focusing on resources available to the Berkeley campus
community.  These now take the form of [DeCal
courses][decal] offered by us. We also offer e-mail and
in-person consulting with our volunteer staff members, as well as online
sources of information about computing on the Berkeley campus and how to use
the available resources.  Additionally, the OCF has conducted career fairs in
the past with its sister organization, the [Computer Science Undergraduate
Association][csua].

Policies for this cluster and decisions for the OCF organization are made
by the OCF Board of Directors, a group of students elected each semester
by the OCF membership.  The Board meetings, held at least once every two
weeks when classes are in session, are open to the public and provide a
chance for any user to express their concerns or opinions about the OCF.
[Minutes of previous meetings][minutes] are also available online.
